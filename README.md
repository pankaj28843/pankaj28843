### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a software engineer based in Copenhagen with over a decade of experience shipping software, simplifying infrastructure, and guiding teams. I specialize in full-stack and platform engineering—solving hard problems with a practical mindset. 

These days, I’m at **SeatGeek**, where I focus on building a Unified Payments Platform for our enterprise customers. Before that, I helped scale systems at **Chainalysis**, tackled optimization problems at **Maersk**, and built core tools from scratch at a fast-paced edtech startup.

What drives me is making things simpler—for users, for developers, and for systems. Whether it’s reining in cloud spend, writing test frameworks that actually catch bugs, or modernizing fragile legacy stacks, I enjoy projects that clear bottlenecks and boost clarity.
